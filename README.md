# Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree - Project 1
Unit 1 Project - Random Quote Generator

For this project, you'll create an app that displays random famous quotes each time a button is clicked. You will select your own quotes from famous historical figures, artists, scientists, celebrities, etc..

Example:

"Every great developer you know got there by solving problems they were unqualified to solve until they actually did it." - Patrick McKenzie
Please select tasteful, positive and uncontroversial quotes, for the sake of this project. Thank you.

You'll use your growing knowledge of basic JavaScript syntax, variables, loops, conditionals and object literals to complete this project.

To help you get started, you'll be supplied with some basic starter files, including the HTML, CSS, and a JavaScript file containing some starter code and comments. But you'll have to:

Locate and select your own quotes
Build the array of quote objects to store the quotes
Write your own functions for selecting random quotes from the array and printing them to the screen.
